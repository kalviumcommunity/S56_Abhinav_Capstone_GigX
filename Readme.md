# GigX: A Freelancer Marketplace
**March 20, 2024**

## Overview
This document outlines the concept and functionalities for GigX, a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). GigX is a freelancer marketplace that utilizes its amazing features to connect freelancers with project opportunities based on skills, budget, and location. My goal is to streamline the freelance hiring process and create a more efficient ecosystem for both clients and freelancers. üöÄ

## Goals
- **Reduce friction in the freelance hiring process:** GigX streamlines project discovery and matches freelancers with relevant opportunities, saving time and effort for both clients and freelancers.
- **Promote a fair and unbiased freelance ecosystem:** Filtering-based matching minimizes human bias in the selection process, providing equal opportunities for all qualified freelancers. ü§ù

## Specifications
GigX will consist of two main user interfaces:
### Client Dashboard:
- Allows clients to post project descriptions with details like required skills, budget, timeline, and location preferences.
- Provides access to search filters to find suitable freelancers.
- Enables communication with shortlisted freelancers, review proposals, and award projects.
- Offers optional project management tools like task creation, file sharing, and progress monitoring. üìä
### Freelancer Dashboard:
- Allows freelancers to create profiles showcasing their skills, experience, portfolio, rates, and availability.
- Enables applying for projects with detailed proposals outlining approach, timeline, and pricing.
- Offers communication channels with clients to discuss project details and negotiate terms. üí¨
